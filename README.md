# spencer-net-shots

a simple way to regularly archive screenshots from different websites to a Github repo or S3 bucket.

## Getting Started

1. Configure shots.yml using the `shot-scraper` documentation for each site you want to archive.
2. Configure your access tokens for Github / AWS

TODO:

- [ ] the shots.yml repo should probably be separate from the repo for archiving shots to avoid needing to pull those assets.
